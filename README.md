# Queue Data Structure

## Description

This is a javascript implementation of a
[stack](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)>)
data structure.

A stack data structure models the notion of 'Last in First Out', or LIFO&mdash;
Considered as a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection, 
the push and pop operations occur only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the stack. 
This makes it possible to implement a stack as a singly linked list and a pointer to the top element. 
A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. 
If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept an entity to be pushed, 
the stack is then considered to be in an overflow state. The pop operation removes an item from the top of the stack.

### Motivation:

The main purpose of this project is implement singly linked list stack data struct.
